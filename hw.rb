puts "Enter a string"
a = gets.chomp 
puts a.reverse 

===============================================
puts "Type a string and I'll check the length:"
words = gets.chomp
# puts string.length >> this is wrong because you have to define words not strings

a = words.length

puts "the string is #{a} words long"
